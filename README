OMAP audio-tool
---------------

The future: There will be an executable called audio-tool that will be
a swiss-army knife for testing and using audio on OMAP.

Now: This is a fork of tinyalsa, patched with our UTR-related patches,
and with two additional tools (pulse-generator and tone-generator).

MANIFEST
--------

As stated before, the goal is to have ONE binary, 'audio-tool'.  But
for now we have:

TARGET BINARIES:

    tinymix - An ALSA mixer control program
    tinyplay - An ALSA playback tool for playing RIFF wave files
    tinycap - An ALSA capture tool for recording RIFF wave files
    tone-generator - A tool for generating misc. waveforms
    pulse-generator - A tool for generating impulses on period boundaries.

HOST BINARIES:

    generate-wave-tables - Generates C-source output with look-up tables
        for various waveforms.

BUILDING
--------

The Makefile builds statically linked binaries for the target
platform.  The binaries for the host platform are usually dynamically
linked.

To build for the host PC, do this:

   $ make

To build for the target device, do this:

   $ export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
   $ make ARCH=arm

...and push the binaries to the device.

LICENSING
---------

At the moment, this is a mixture of Apache 2.0 and BSD licensing.

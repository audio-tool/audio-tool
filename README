OMAP audio-tool
---------------

The future: There will be an executable called audio-tool that will be
a swiss-army knife for testing and using audio on OMAP.

Now: This is a fork of tinyalsa, patched with our UTR-related patches,
and with two additional tools (pulse-generator and tone-generator).

MANIFEST
--------

As stated before, the goal is to have ONE binary, 'audio-tool'.  But
for now we have:

TARGET BINARIES:

    tinymix - An ALSA mixer control program
    tinyplay - An ALSA playback tool for playing RIFF wave files
    tinycap - An ALSA capture tool for recording RIFF wave files
    tone-generator - A tool for generating misc. waveforms
    pulse-generator - A tool for generating impulses on period boundaries.

HOST BINARIES:

    generate-wave-tables - Generates C-source output with look-up tables
        for various waveforms.

BUILDING
--------

The Makefile builds statically linked binaries for the target
platform.  The binaries for the host platform are usually dynamically
linked.

To build for the host PC, do this:

   $ make

To build for the target device, do this:

   $ export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
   $ make ARCH=arm

...and push the binaries to the device.

LICENSING
---------

At the moment, this is a mixture of Apache 2.0 and BSD licensing.

IDEAS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
---------------------------

* Consolidate all target binaries to ONE binary:

    tinyplay ==> audio-tool play
    tinycap ==> audio-tool cap
    tinymix ==> audio-tool mix
    pulse-generator ==> audio-tool pulse
    tone-generator ==> audio-tool tone
    (sanity test) ==> audio-tool test sanity

* Use getopt (and maybe gengetopt) for CLI parsing.

* On unit tests, android's test tool looks for the last output
  line instead of the OS return code for pass/fail.  Make sure
  that we're compatible with that.

* Add support for using the mmap() API in the tests and/or
  play/cap.

* Support UCM

* Test multi-port configurations (e.g. play a system tone during
  mm playback.  Capture/playback at the same time over misc. ports.

* Support saving and restoring of mixer configuration (like alsaconf)
